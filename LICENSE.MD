# GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) - Simplified

## Purpose

The AGPLv3 license aims to ensure:
- **Freedom and Cooperation**: To guarantee users the freedom to share, modify, and use the software, fostering community cooperation, especially for network server software.

## Main Features

- **Free Software**: Focuses on freedom, not price. It allows users to:
  - Distribute, modify, or use the software freely, even for commercial purposes.
  - Access the source code.
  - Create modifications and derivative works under the same license terms.

- **Network Use**: Unique to AGPLv3, modifications that run on a network server must make their source code available to users.

- **Copyleft**: Strong copyleft terms mean any distributed modifications or derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3.

## Terms and Conditions

- **Definitions**: Clarifies terms like "Program," "modify," and legal usage and sharing.

- **Permissions**: Grants rights to use, modify, and distribute the software, provided compliance with the license.

- **Conditions for Distribution**: Requires that modified versions be shared under AGPLv3, including providing source code for networked software.

- **Limitations and Responsibilities**: Disclaims warranties and limits liability to protect developers.

## Applying the License

To apply AGPLv3 to your program:
1. Attach AGPLv3 notices to your program to inform users it's licensed under AGPLv3 and where to find the license.
2. Ensure a way for users to access the source code, especially if your software is accessed over a network.

This license ensures software, particularly networked applications, remains free and open, promoting transparency and community collaboration.
