## Battle Hard Contract (Locker)

### About

Battle Hardened is a soft locker system designed to revitalize NFT projects by allowing users to create lockers that are minted with stats by an external server. Users can unfuse items (soft burn) to obtain a blueprint of the locker or hard burn to return all relevant items. The contract facilitates merging up to 4 NFTs, with users having full autonomy over their collections at all times.
